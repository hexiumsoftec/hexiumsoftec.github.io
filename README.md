#### 1. Introduction and scope
   
In this section, the focus is to give an introduction to the current AI revolution and the scopeof AI.
In recent years, some revolutionary changes happened in the field of Artificial intelligence and this is the perfect time for us to learn AI. Unlike the past few years, we now know the methodes to learn AI and we have the hardware that is required in our personal computers. The introduction of GPU powered deep learning models revolutionized the entire industry. Now, It is time for us to learn AI. Before that, Let's see some examples.

This particular example is Google DeepMind's Deep Q-learning playing Atari Breakout. This is using a concept called Reinforced learning. When we try to throw a basket ball into the basket, after several attempts, we finally learn that throwing it in a particular angle at a particular speed, it is possible to put the ball inside the basket. Just like that, learning the environment and reconfigauring the artifcial neural networks, it is possible for the machine to learn the perfect way to solve problems, some times better than us.

   #### Basic introduction and hands on training, Computer vision 
  
   Computer Vision can be defined as a discipline that explains how to reconstruct, interrupt, and understand a 3D scene from its 2D images, in terms of the properties of the structure present in the scene. It deals with modeling and replicating human vision using computer software and hardware.
Computer Vision overlaps significantly with the following fields −ll

   • Image Processing − It focuses on image manipulation.
     
   • Pattern Recognition − It explains various techniques to classify patterns.
     
   • Photogrammetry − It is concerned with obtaining accurate measurements from images.
     
  #### Computer Vision Vs Image Processing
   
Image processing deals with image-to-image transformation. The input and output of image processing are both images.
Computer vision is the construction of explicit, meaningful descriptions of physical objects from their image. The output of computer vision is a description or an interpretation of structures in 3D scene.
Applications of Computer Vision
Here we have listed down some of major domains where Computer Vision is heavily used.
Robotics Application
   
   • Localization − Determine robot location automatically
   
   • Navigation
   
   • Obstacles avoidance
   
   • Assembly (peg-in-hole, welding, painting)
   
   • Manipulation (e.g. PUMA robot manipulator)
   
   • Human Robot Interaction (HRI) − Intelligent robotics to interact with and serve people

#### Medicine Application
    
   • Classification and detection (e.g. lesion or cells classification and tumor detection)
   
   • 2D/3D segmentation
   
   • 3D human organ reconstruction (MRI or ultrasound)
   
   • Vision-guided robotics surgery

#### Industrial Automation Application
    
   • Industrial inspection (defect detection)
   
   • Assembly
   
   • Barcode and package label reading
   
   • Object sorting
   
   • Document understanding (e.g. OCR)
#### Security Application

• Biometrics (iris, finger print, face recognition)

• Surveillance − Detecting certain suspicious activities or behaviors
Transportation Application

• Autonomous vehicle

• Safety, e.g., driver vigilance monitoring
Features of OpenCV Library

## Using OpenCV library, you can −
   
   • Read and write images
   
   • Capture and save videos
   
   • Process images (filter, transform)
   
   • Perform feature detection
   
   • Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.
   
   • Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.
OpenCV was originally developed in C++. In addition to it, Python and Java bindings were provided. OpenCV runs on various Operating Systems such as windows, Linux, OSx, FreeBSD, Net BSD, Open BSD, etc.
This tutorial explains the concepts of OpenCV with examples using Java bindings.
OpenCV Library Modules
Following are the main library modules of the OpenCV library.

## Core Functionality
   This module covers the basic data structures such as Scalar, Point, Range, etc., that are used to build OpenCV applications. In addition to these, it also includes the multidimensional array Mat, which is used to store the images. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.core.

## Image Processing
   This module covers various image processing operations such as image filtering, geometrical image transformations, color space conversion, histograms, etc. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.imgproc.

## Video
   This module covers the video analysis concepts such as motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.video.

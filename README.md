### 1. Introduction and scope
   
In this section, the focus is to give an introduction to the current AI revolution and the scopeof AI.
In recent years, some revolutionary changes happened in the field of Artificial intelligence and this is the perfect time for us to learn AI. Unlike the past few years, we now know the methodes to learn AI and we have the hardware that is required in our personal computers. The introduction of GPU powered deep learning models revolutionized the entire industry. Now, It is time for us to learn AI. Before that, Let's see some examples.

This particular example is Google DeepMind's Deep Q-learning playing Atari Breakout. This is using a concept called Reinforced learning. 

When we try to throw a basket ball into the basket, after several attempts, we finally learn that throwing it in a particular angle at a particular speed, it is possible to put the ball inside the basket. Just like that, learning the environment and reconfigauring the artifcial neural networks, it is possible for the machine to learn the perfect way to solve problems, some times better than us. After the completion of this cource, The learner will be able to implement some most challenging AI problems.

#### Human brain and intelligence
 
 The human brain is the most complex organ in our bodies. Scientists are working on the problem of knowing how the brain works. Even now, we only have a limitted knowledge about the working of human brain. But we can use the assumptions and some proofs by the discoverers of some details on how human brain works to learn about Artificial intelligence. The concept of artificial intelligence depends on some of the terms used in human intelligent system to better understand the concept, but even the greatest minds in the field of artificial intelligence like Andrew NG and Geoferry Hinton says that we are still pursuing the challenge to learn about the real working of human brain.
 
 But as far as we know, The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, and protected by, the skull bones of the head. The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by commissural nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum >(Source wikipedia)
 
 The human brain learns new things from it's surroundings. Imagine when a child touches fire for the first time, after getting the burn, he will not dare to touch something that is red and glows. This type of learning is natural. When we go to school and learns that 2 is a number and it is used to represent some value, This is learnt from the teacher who repeatedly shows this number and tells you that the number is Two. Human brain decodes the signal from the sensories and use them to find a meaning to that and learns it's features for the future. Hearing a pleasent music or good smell of food will make you feel comfortable and heavy traffic troubles makes you angry. Everything is learnt, memorized and used inorder to react to situations that lies ahead. 
 
 Artificial intelligence works similarly, but not as efficient as human brain. We were able to achieve more accuracy in predicting something from an image using computer vision than a normal human being, but the technology can be easily fooled. Human brain is still a highly complex system that works differently than what we are going to learn but knowing the concept of knowledge(Memory, structured information used at the right time), Information(Data arranged in a good manner) and Data is going to help us understand the theories of AI.
 
#### Computers Intelligence Vs Human intelligence
  
  First computers were used to solve simple mathematical problems and they are good at it. Artificial intelligence as we know it is pure mathematics, but even for solving a small problem, it would take a normal human being his lifetime to do these calculations. But the truth is that we can process do much more things than a computer can, in terms of intelligence. Computers don't have the ability to imagine new things, it only knows the data that it got and that data is the main thing that drives it. An AI system might be able to solve a

#### History of Artificial intelligence

The following details are from [Wiipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_artificial_intelligence)

The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen; as Pamela McCorduck writes, AI began with "an ancient wish to forge the gods." 

The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.

The earliest research into thinking machines was inspired by a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that it might be possible to construct an electronic brain.

In 1950 Alan Turing published a landmark paper in which he speculated about the possibility of creating machines that think. He noted that "thinking" is difficult to define and devised his famous Turing Test. If a machine could carry on a conversation (over a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from a conversation with a human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was "thinking". This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a "thinking machine" was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition. The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.
 
### 2. Intoductionto the technologies used in AI




















### Appendix 1. A crash cource in python for AI

Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means it runs on all the major operating systems. Any Python program you write should run on any modern computer that has Python installed. However, the methods for setting up Python on different operating systems vary slightly. In this section you’ll learn how to set up Python and run the Hello World program on your own system. You’ll first check whether Python is installed on your system and install it if it’s not. Then you’ll install a simple text edi- tor and save an empty Python file called hello_world.py. Finally, you’ll run the Hello World program and troubleshoot anything that didn’t work. I’ll walk you through this process for each operating system, so you’ll have a beginner-friendly Python programming environment.

### Python on Linux
Linux systems are designed for programming, so Python is already installed on most Linux computers. The people who write and maintain Linux expect you to do your own programming at some point and encourage you to do so. For this reason there’s very little you have to install and very few settings you have to change to start programming. Checking Your Version of Python Open a terminal window by running the Terminal application on your system (in Ubuntu, you can press ctrl- alt -T). To find out whether Python is installed, enter python with a lowercase p. You should see output telling you which version of Python is installed and a >>> prompt where you can start entering Python commands, like this:
```sh
$ python
Python 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 22:59:38)
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
This output tells you that Python 2.7.6 is currently the default version of Python installed on this computer. When you’ve seen this output, press ctrl-D or enter exit() to leave the Python prompt and return to a terminal prompt.
Running Python Programs from a Terminal
Most of the programs you write in your text editor you’ll run directly
from the editor, but sometimes it’s useful to run programs from a terminal
instead. For example, you might want to run an existing program without
opening it for editing.
You can do this on any system with Python installed if you know how
to access the directory where you’ve stored your program file. To try this,
make sure you’ve saved the hello_world.py file in the python_work folder on
your desktop.
   Running a Python program from a terminal session is the same on Linux. The terminal command cd, for change directory, is used to navi-gate through your file system in a terminal session. The command ls, for list, shows you all the non-hidden files that exist in the current directory. Open a new terminal window and issue the following commands to run
hello_world.py:
```sh
u ~$ cd Desktop/python_work/
v ~/Desktop/python_work$ ls
hello_world.py
w ~/Desktop/python_work$ python hello_world.py
Hello Python world!
 ```
python hello_world.py
It’s that simple. You just use the python (or python3) command to run Python programs.



#### Variables and Si m p l e D a t a T y p e s

We will discus  about the different kinds of data you can work with in your Python programs. You’ll also learn how to store your data in variables and how to use those variables in your programs.


##### Variables
Let’s try using a variable in hello_world.py. Add a new line at the beginning of the file, and modify the second line:
```sh
message = "Hello Python world!"
print(message)
```
Run this program to see what happens. You should see the same output you saw previously:
```sh
Hello Python world!
```
We’ve added a variable named message. Every variable holds a value, which is the information associated with that variable. In this case the value is the text “Hello Python world!”.Adding a variable makes a little more work for the Python interpreter. When it processes the first line, it associates the text “Hello Python world!” with the variable message. When it reaches the second line, it prints the value associated with message to the screen.
        Let’s expand on this program by modifying hello_world.py to print a sec- ond message. Add a blank line to hello_world.py, and then add two new lines of code:
```sh
        message = "Hello Python world!"
        print(message)
        message = "Hello Python Crash Course world!"
        print(message)
```
Now when you run hello_world.py, you should see two lines of output:
Hello Python world! Hello Python Crash Course world!
You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time, and Python will always keep track of its current value.
##### Naming and Using Variables
When you’re using variables in Python, you need to adhere to a few rules and guidelines. Breaking some of these rules will cause errors; other guide- lines just help you write code that’s easier to read and understand. Be sure to keep the following variable rules in mind: 

- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message.
- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message works, but greeting message will cause errors.
- Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular pro- grammatic purpose, such as the word print.
- Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.
- Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
It can take some practice to learn how to create good variable names, especially as your programs become more interesting and complicated. As you write more programs and start to read through other people’s code, you’ll get better at coming up with meaningful names.
--Note
The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get
errors if you use uppercase letters, but it’s a good idea to avoid using them for now.

##### Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables
Every programmer makes mistakes, and most make mistakes every day. Although good programmers might create errors, they also know how to respond to those errors efficiently. Let’s look at an error you’re likely to make early on and learn how to fix it. We’ll write some code that generates an error on purpose. Enter the following code, including the misspelled word mesage shown in bold:
```sh
message = "Hello Python Crash Course reader!"
print(mesage)
```
When an error occurs in your program, the Python interpreter does its best to help you figure out where the problem is. The interpreter provides a traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A traceback is a record of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code. Here’s an example of the traceback that Python provides after you’ve accidentally misspelled a variable’s name:
```sh
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "hello_world.py", line 2, in <module>
 print(mesage)
NameError: name 'mesage' is not defined
```
The output at u reports that an error occurs in line 2 of the file hello_world.py. The interpreter shows this line to help us spot the error quickly v and tells us what kind of error it found w. In this case it found a name error and reports that the variable being printed, mesage, has not been defined. Python can’t identify the variable name provided. A name error usually means we either forgot to set a variable’s value before using it, or we made a spelling mistake when entering the variable’s name. Of course, in this example we omitted the letter s in the variable name message in the second line. The Python interpreter doesn’t spellcheck your code, but it does ensure that variable names are spelled consistently. For example, watch what happens when we spell message incorrectly in another place in the code as well: 
```sh
mesage = "Hello Python Crash Course reader!"
print(mesage)
In this case, the program runs successfully!
Hello Python Crash Course reader!
```
Computers are strict, but they disregard good and bad spelling. As a result, you don’t need to consider English spelling and grammar rules when you’re trying to create variable names and writing code. Many programming errors are simple, single-character typos in one line of a program. If you’re spending a long time searching for one of these errors, know that you’re in good company. Many experienced and talented programmers spend hours hunting down these kinds of tiny errors. Try to laugh about it and move on, knowing it will happen frequently throughout your programming life.
#### Strings
Because most programs define and gather some sort of data, and then do something useful with it, it helps to classify different types of data. The first data type we’ll look at is the string. Strings are quite simple at first glance, but you can use them in many different ways. A string is simply a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is con- sidered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around
your strings like this:
```sh
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'
```
This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your
strings:
        'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
        "The language 'Python' is named after Monty Python, not the snake."
        "One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."


##### Changing Case in a String with Methods
One of the simplest tasks you can do with strings is change the case of the words in a string. Look at the following code, and try to determine what’s happening:
```sh
name = "ada lovelace"
print(name.title())
```
Save this file as name.py, and then run it. You should see this output: Ada Lovelace In this example, the lowercase string "ada lovelace" is stored in the variable name. The method title() appears after the variable in the print() state- ment. A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot ( .) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work. That information is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn’t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty. title() displays each word in title-case, where each word begins with a capital letter. This is useful because you’ll often want to think of a name as a piece of information. For example, you might want your program to recognize the input values Ada, ADA, and ada as the same name, and display all of them as Ada
Several other useful methods are available for dealing with case as well.
For example, you can change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase letters
like this:
```sh
name = "Ada Lovelace"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
```
This will display the following:
```sh
ADA LOVELACE
ada lovelace
```
The lower() method is particularly useful for storing data. Many times you won’t want to trust the capitalization that your users provide, so you’ll convert strings to lowercase before storing them. Then when you want to display the information, you’ll use the case that makes the most sense for each string.

##### Combining or Concatenating Strings
It’s often useful to combine strings. For example, you might want to store a first name and a last name in separate variables, and then combine them when you want to display someone’s full name:
```sh
first_name = "ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
```
Python uses the plus symbol (+) to combine strings. In this example, we use + to create a full name by combining a first_name, a space, and a last_name u, giving this result:
```sh
ada lovelace
```
This method of combining strings is called concatenation. You can use concatenation to compose complete messages using the information you’ve stored in a variable. Let’s look at an example:
```sh
first_name = "ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
u print("Hello, " + full_name.title() + "!")
```
Here, the full name is used at u in a sentence that greets the user, and the title() method is used to format the name appropriately. This code returns a simple but nicely formatted greeting:
```sh
Hello, Ada Lovelace!
```
You can use concatenation to compose a message and then store the entire message in a variable:
```sh
first_name = "ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
u message = "Hello, " + full_name.title() + "!"
v print(message)
```
This code displays the message “Hello, Ada Lovelace!” as well, but storing the message in a variable at u makes the final print statement at much simpler.

#### Numbers
Numbers are used quite often in programming to keep score in games, rep- resent data in visualizations, store information in web applications, and so on. Python treats numbers in several different ways, depending on how they are being used. Let’s first look at how Python manages integers, because they are the simplest to work with.
##### Integers
You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply ( *), and divide ( /) integers in Python.
```sh
>>>
 2 + 3
5
>>>
 3 - 2
1
>>>
 2 * 3
6
>>>
 3 / 2
1.5
```
In a terminal session, Python simply returns the result of the operation. Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents: 
```sh
>>> 3 ** 2
9
>>> 3 ** 3
27
>>> 10 ** 6
1000000
```
Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order you specify. For example: 
```sh
>>> 2 + 3*4
14
>>> (2 + 3) * 4
20
```
The spacing in these examples has no effect on how Python evaluates the expressions; it simply helps you more quickly spot the operations that have priority when you’re reading through the code. 
##### Floats
Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can appear at any position in a number. Every programming language must be carefully designed to properly manage decimal numbers so numbers behave appropriately no matter where the decimal point appears. For the most part, you can use decimals without worrying about how they behave. Simply enter the numbers you want to use, and Python will most likely do what you expect: 
```sh
>>>
 0.1 + 0.1
0.2
>>>
 0.2 + 0.2
0.4
>>>
 2 * 0.1
0.2
>>>
 2 * 0.2
0.4
```
But be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer: 
```sh
>>> 0.2 + 0.1
0.30000000000000004
>>> 3 * 0.1
0.30000000000000004
```
This happens in all languages and is of little concern. Python tries to find a way to represent the result as precisely as possible, which is sometimes difficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally.
#### Inroducing Lists

>>A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0–9, or the names of all the people in your family. You can put anything you want into a list, and bicycles.py the items in your list don’t have to be related in any particular way. Because a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the name of your list plural, such as letters, digits, or names.

In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas. Here’s a simple example of a list that contains a few kinds of bicycles:
```sh
 bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
```
If you ask Python to print a list, Python returns its representation of the list, including the square brackets:
```sh
['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
```
Because this isn’t the output you want your users to see, let’s learn how to access the individual items in a list. 
#### Accessing Elements in a List
Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an ele- ment in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets. For example, let’s pull out the first bicycle in the list bicycles: ```sh
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
u print(bicycles[0])
```
The syntax for this is shown at u. When we ask for a single item from a list, Python returns just that element without square brackets or quotation marks: ```sh
trek
```
This is the result you want your users to see—clean, neatly formatted output. You can also use the string methods from Chapter 2 on any element in a list. For example, you can format the element 'trek' more neatly by using the title() method:
```sh
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[0].title())
```
This example produces the same output as the preceding example except 'Trek' is capitalized.

Python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1. This is true of most programming languages, and the reason has to do with how the list operations are implemented at a lower level. If you’re receiving unexpected results, determine whether you are making a simple off-by-one error. The second item in a list has an index of 1. Using this simple counting system, you can get any element you want from a list by subtracting one from its position in the list. For instance, to access the fourth item in a list, you request the item at index 3. The following asks for the bicycles at index 1 and index 3:
```sh
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[1])
print(bicycles[3])
```
This code returns the second and fourth bicycles in the list:
```sh
cannondale
specialized
```
Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. By asking for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list:
```sh
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[-1])
```
This code returns the value 'specialized'. This syntax is quite useful, because you’ll often want to access the last items in a list without knowing exactly how long the list is. This convention extends to other negative index values as well. The index -2 returns the second item from the end of the list, the index -3 returns the third item from the end, and so forth. Using Individual Values from a List You can use individual values from a list just as you would any other vari- able. For example, you can use concatenation to create a message based on a value from a list. Let’s try pulling the first bicycle from the list and composing a message using that value.
```sh
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
u message = "My first bicycle was a " + bicycles[0].title() + "."
print(message)
```

 we build a sentence using the value at bicycles[0] and store it in the variable message. The output is a simple sentence about the first bicycle in the list: My first bicycle was a Trek.
##### Try It Yourself

>Try these short programs to get some firsthand experience with Python’s lists. You might want to create a new folder for each chapter’s exercises to keep them organized.

> Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

>Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each mes- sage should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

>Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

#### Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements
Most lists you create will be dynamic, meaning you’ll build a list and then add and remove elements from it as your program runs its course. For example, you might create a game in which a player has to shoot aliens out of the sky. You could store the initial set of aliens in a list and then remove an alien from the list each time one is shot down. Each time a new alien appears on the screen, you add it to the list. Your list of aliens will decrease and increase in length throughout the course of the game. 
##### Modifying Elements in a List
The syntax for modifying an element is similar to the syntax for accessing an element in a list. To change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have. For example, let’s say we have a list of motorcycles, and the first item in the list is 'honda' . How would we change the value of this first item? 
```sh
motorcycles.py u motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
v motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
print(motorcycles)
```
The code at u defines the original list, with 'honda' as the first element. The code at v changes the value of the first item to 'ducati'. The output shows that the first item has indeed been changed, and the rest of the list stays the same:
```sh
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['ducati', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
```
You can change the value of any item in a list, not just the first item. Adding Elements to a List You might want to add a new element to a list for many reasons. For example, you might want to make new aliens appear in a game, add new data to a visualization, or add new registered users to a website you’ve built. Python provides several ways to add new data to existing lists. 
##### Appending Elements to the End of a List
The simplest way to add a new element to a list is to append the item to the
list. When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the end
of the list. Using the same list we had in the previous example, we’ll add the
new element 'ducati' to the end of the list:
```sh
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
umotorcycles.append('ducati')
print(motorcycles)
```
The append() method at u adds 'ducati' to the end of the list without affecting any of the other elements in the list: 
```sh
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
```

The append() method makes it easy to build lists dynamically. For example, you can start with an empty list and then add items to the list using a series of append() statements. Using an empty list, let’s add the elements 'honda', 'yamaha', and 'suzuki' to the list:
```sh
motorcycles = []
motorcycles.append('honda')
motorcycles.append('yamaha')
motorcycles.append('suzuki')
print(motorcycles)
```
The resulting list looks exactly the same as the lists in the previous examples:
```sh
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
```
Building lists this way is very common, because you often won’t know the data your users want to store in a program until after the program is running. To put your users in control, start by defining an empty list that will hold the users’ values. Then append each new value provided to the list you just created. 
##### Inserting Elements into a List
You can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() method. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the value of the new item. ```sh
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
u motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')
print(motorcycles)
```
In this example, the code at u inserts the value 'ducati' at the begin- ning of the list. The insert() method opens a space at position 0 and stores the value 'ducati' at that location. This operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the right: 
```sh
['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']

```
##### Removing Elements from a List
Often, you’ll want to remove an item or a set of items from a list. For example, when a player shoots down an alien from the sky, you’ll most likely want to remove it from the list of active aliens. Or when a user decides to cancel their account on a web application you created, you’ll want to remove that user from the list of active users. You can remove an item according to its position in the list or according to its value. 
###### Removing an Item Using the del Statement
If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can
use the del statement.
```sh
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
del motorcycles[0]
print(motorcycles)
```
The code at u uses del to remove the first item, 'honda', from the list of motorcycles:
```sh
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['yamaha', 'suzuki']
```

##### Let’s pop a motorcycle from the list of motorcycles:
```sh
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()
print(motorcycles)
print(popped_motorcycle)
```
We start by defining and printing the list motorcycles at u. At v we pop a value from the list and store that value in the variable popped_motorcycle. We print the list at w to show that a value has been removed from the list. Then we print the popped value at x to prove that we still have access to the value that was removed. The output shows that the value 'suzuki' was removed from the end of the list and is now stored in the variable popped_motorcycle: 
```sh
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'yamaha']
suzuki
```


 
   
### Appendix 3. Computer vision

#### Basic introduction and hands on training, Computer vision 
  
   Computer Vision can be defined as a discipline that explains how to reconstruct, interrupt, and understand a 3D scene from its 2D images, in terms of the properties of the structure present in the scene. It deals with modeling and replicating human vision using computer software and hardware.
Computer Vision overlaps significantly with the following fields −ll

   • Image Processing − It focuses on image manipulation.
     
   • Pattern Recognition − It explains various techniques to classify patterns.
     
   • Photogrammetry − It is concerned with obtaining accurate measurements from images.
   
     
#### Computer Vision Vs Image Processing
   
Image processing deals with image-to-image transformation. The input and output of image processing are both images.
Computer vision is the construction of explicit, meaningful descriptions of physical objects from their image. The output of computer vision is a description or an interpretation of structures in 3D scene.
Applications of Computer Vision
Here we have listed down some of major domains where Computer Vision is heavily used.

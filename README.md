## Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning cource 

This repository contains all the codes, cource details, pdfs and examples to the AI and machine learning cource. 
The main objective of this cource is to give students the basic idea about AI and make the learning process simple and easy.

## Contents

#### 1. Introduction and scope
   
In this section, the focus is to give an introduction to the current AI revolution and the scopeof AI.
In recent years, some revolutionary changes happened in the field of Artificial intelligence and this is the perfect time for us to learn AI. Unlike the past few years, we now know the methodes to learn AI and we have the hardware that is required in our personal computers. The introduction of GPU powered deep learning models revolutionized the entire industry. Now, It is time for us to learn AI. Before that, Let's see some examples.

This particular example is Google DeepMind's Deep Q-learning playing Atari Breakout. This is using a concept called Reinforced learning. When we try to throw a basket ball into the basket, after several attempts, we finally learn that throwing it in a particular angle at a particular speed, it is possible to put the ball inside the basket. Just like that, learning the environment and reconfigauring the artifcial neural networks, it is possible for the machine to learn the perfect way to solve problems, some times better than us.
